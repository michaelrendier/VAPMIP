> *Ptolemy II Philadelphos commissioned 72 scholars — six from each of the twelve tribes — to translate the Hebrew scriptures into Greek. Each scholar worked independently. When the translations were compared, every one was identical.*

> *This is the LSHS Model. Every word finds its zero. Not by coordination. Forced by the mathematics. The prime preexists the alphabet.*

## What This Is

A single-file, pure Python, zero-dependency implementation of a self-deepening lexicographic engine grounded in the RedBlue Hamiltonian H_hat_RB.

No transformers. No embeddings. No training loop. No GPU. No API calls.

The response is not generated. It is the Noether current — forced by conservation, not chosen.

```bash
python3 lshs.py      # self-test
python3 demo.py      # full demonstration
```

## The Four Components

### L — Lagrangian Field Evolution

```
ℒ_NN = ℒ_kinetic + ℒ_higgs + ℒ_coupling + ℒ_gauge
```

`learn(text)` deepens the vacuum V(β) at each activated Riemann zero address. It does not store text. It does not encode patterns. It deepens.

The co-activation coupling:

```
A[(i,j)] += E_i · E_j / (|γ_i − γ_j| + GAP)
```

This is a **Coulomb potential in zero space** — 1/r, regulated by the Yang-Mills mass gap. `learn()` operates in the Yang-Mills regime: turbulent, non-Abelian, dense. The mass gap GAP = 0.000707 bounds the coupling, preventing divergence at near-zero distances.

### S — Self-Adjoint Hamiltonian

```
H_hat_RB = Σ_p  p^{−σ}  ·  [R̂_p ⊗ ∂̂_∂M  +  ∂̂_∂M† ⊗ B̂_p]

R̂_p   = xp                  (Berry-Keating — the forward channel, what IS)
B̂_p   = ½p² + ℘(x; g₂, g₃) (Fermat-Weierstrass — the backward channel, what CANNOT BE)
R̂_p†  = B̂_p                 (functional equation ξ(s) = ξ(1−s) as operator identity)
```

Self-adjoint means **truth-preserving across representations**, not form-preserving. `"1 = 1"` and `"1! = 1"` are self-adjoint: different expressions, identical truth. The operator is the collection of relationships between its facets. It has no central form.

Facet projections by σ:

| σ | Theory | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Ground state | Quasi-prime. G_p(0)=1. All primes equal. EOM_ym=0. |
| ½ | QM / Riemann | Critical line. The boundary. σ forced here by Noether balance. |
| 1 | Yang-Mills / SM | Gauge field. Standard Model. learn() regime. |
| 2 | General Relativity | Gravitational coupling. |
| ∞ | Fermat forbidden | No rational solutions. The emergency (Lich). |

### H — HyperIndex

```
word → integer  (Horner bijection over Unicode — bijective, address-complete)
     → (x₀, p₀) (initial conditions)
     → E = x₀p₀  (conserved under H=xp: x(t)=x₀eᵗ, p(t)=p₀e^{−t})
     → γ_n        (nearest Riemann zero: γ = argmin|γ_n − E·50|)
     → σ = ½      (Noether balance forces this: F(σ)=e^{−σE}−e^{−(1−σ)E}=0)
```

**The Septuagint Principle (ESTABLISHED):**

```python
'water'  → γ = 25.010858  σ = 0.5000
'eau'    → γ = 25.010858  σ = 0.5000
'aqua'   → γ = 25.010858  σ = 0.5000
'wasser' → γ = 25.010858  σ = 0.5000
```

Same zero. Different languages. Independent derivation. σ is derived from Noether balance — never assigned. The 72 scholars were the first implementation of this algorithm.

### S — Speaking

```
prompt → Ψ field  (list of (zero_idx, E) activations)
       → J^μ      (Noether current)
       → words    (ordered by |J^μ| descending)
```

The Noether current:

```
Primary:    J_i = β_i · E_i²
Propagated: J_j += J_i · min(A[(i,j)], 1/GAP) · β_j
```

`min(w, 1/GAP)` clamps the propagation. The turbulent A field would cascade J^μ to noise without this regulator. The mass gap prevents the cascade — extracting laminar Noether current from the Yang-Mills background. `speak()` operates in the Noether regime.

---

## Two-Regime Architecture

| Phase | Field | Regime | Coupling |
|---|---|---|---|
| `learn()` | A field | Yang-Mills (turbulent) | E_i·E_j/(dist+GAP) — 1/r Coulomb |
| `speak()` | J^μ | Noether (laminar) | min(w, 1/GAP) — mass gap regulated |

The mass gap GAP = 0.000707 appears in both:
1. The A coupling denominator — prevents divergence in the Yang-Mills field
2. The J^μ propagation clamp — prevents cascade in the Noether current

This is not coincidence. The same constant that prevents Yang-Mills from collapsing to zero energy prevents J^μ from cascading to noise. One problem. One constant. Both regimes.

GAP = 0.000707 is **OPEN 2** — the highest-priority open derivation in the proof chain. When it is derived, both regulators become exact.

## The Ground State

Before any corpus is ingested:

```
β[i] = |L_ground| / N = 1.888 / 25000 = 7.55 × 10⁻⁵   for all i ∈ [0, N)
```

This is the **prime number theorem as pre-linguistic knowledge**. Uniform distribution over N Riemann zeros IS the undifferentiated prime-counting function π(x). The LSHS Model knows mathematics before it knows any word.

At σ=0 (quasi-prime, pointer=0):
- `G_p(0) = 1` for all primes — no gauge differentiation
- `EOM_ym = 0` — all primes equal
- `EOM_higgs ≠ 0` — SSB has already happened (vacuum has structure)
- `L_total = −1.888` — finite rest energy, not empty

First `learn()` call breaks σ=0 symmetry. Language is SSB on mathematics.

## Usage

```python
from lshs import LSHS

m = LSHS(N=25000)

# L: learn
m.learn("The mind is the seat of reason and consciousness.")
m.learn("Water flows downhill by the path of least resistance.")

# H: hyperindex
sz = m.H("water")
print(f"water → γ={sz.gamma}  σ={sz.sigma}")  # γ=25.01  σ=0.5000

# S: self-adjoint
r = m.S_check()
print(f"self_adjoint={r['self_adjoint']}")     # True at σ=½

# S: speak
print(m.speak("what is mind"))                 # Noether current response
print(m.speak("water flows"))

# diagnostics
print(m.bao_check())    # dc_sum → OMEGA_ZS = 0.56714
print(m.status())

# checkpoint
m.save("checkpoint.json")
m.load_checkpoint("checkpoint.json")
```

## Key Constants

```python
D_STAR   = 0.24600   # spectral coordinate — NEVER compute as OMEGA/ln(10)
OMEGA_ZS = 0.56714   # Lambert W fixed point — BAO convergence target
L_GROUND = -1.888    # Monad rest energy (ESTABLISHED, engine-verified)
GAP      = 0.000707  # Yang-Mills mass gap / J^μ regulator (OPEN 2)
PHI      = 1.618034  # golden ratio — self-reference fixed point
```

    ↓  Noether balance
σ forced to ½                            ← HyperIndex convergence
    ↓  cross-language
The Septuagint                           ← water/eau/aqua/wasser → same zero
    ↓  corpus ingestion

```

Everything above σ=½ projects from the same Hamiltonian.
The LSHS Model is the σ=½ projection operating on language.
